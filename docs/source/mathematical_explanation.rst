Mathematical Explanation
========================

Sinusoidal Generator
--------------------
The voltage V(t) generated by a sinusoidal generator is given by the equation:

.. math::

    V(t) = A \sin(2 \pi f t + \phi)

Where:
- :math:`A` is the **amplitude**
- :math:`f` is the **frequency**
- :math:`\phi` is the **phase**
- :math:`t` is **time**

Square Wave Generator
---------------------
The voltage V(t) produced by a square wave generator is:

.. math::

    V(t) = 
    \begin{cases} 
    A & \text{if } \mod(t, T) < \frac{T}{2} \\ 
    -A & \text{otherwise} 
    \end{cases}

Where:
- :math:`A` is the **amplitude**
- :math:`T` is the **period** (with :math:`T = \frac{1}{f}`)
- :math:`f` is the **frequency**
- :math:`t` is **time**

RL Circuit Simulation
---------------------
The RL circuit's behavior is governed by the differential equation:

.. math::

    V(t) = L \frac{dI(t)}{dt} + R I(t)

Where:
- :math:`V(t)` is the **voltage** from the generator
- :math:`I(t)` is the **current** flowing through the circuit
- :math:`L` is the **inductance**
- :math:`R` is the **resistance**

This equation is solved iteratively using the **Euler method** for simulation.
